## Local development environment (with Docker)

1. Clone/Download this repository
2. Run `docker-compose pull` in the root directory of this repository
3. Run `docker-compose up --build` in the root directory of this repository
4. `ka-ching-backend` is now running on `localhost:4567`
5. Want to use `binding.pry`? Then: `docker attach ka-ching-demo-frontend-1` in another terminal window üòé

### IMPORTANT If it is your first time running the application<!-- omit in toc -->

**You will need to initialize the database.**  
To do so, run `docker-compose run --rm backend bin/setup` in another terminal window.  
This will create the database and populate it with some sample data.
THEN stop your containers `ctrl + c` to fire everything up, for good `docker-compose up`.
