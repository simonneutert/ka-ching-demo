### Reset the database

Then run `docker-compose up --build` again. And follow the steps below once more üòâ

### IMPORTANT If it is your first time running the application<!-- omit in toc -->

**You will need to initialize the database.**  
To do so, run `docker-compose run --rm backend bin/setup` in another terminal window.  
This will create the database and populate it with some sample data.
THEN stop your containers `ctrl + c` to fire everything up, for good `docker-compose up`.
